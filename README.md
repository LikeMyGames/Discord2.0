## Use Without Account:
This is currently the only option on the welcome screen that works. This generates a random ID that gets both alerted to the user and by default, is part of the user name, which by default is "Untitled (ID: ${id})".

## Content to Another User:
To connect to another user, all you need is their id. At the top of the bar second from the left in desktop mode, and second from the top in mobile mode, their should be a button with a plus button on it. Click or tap this plus button and a screen with an input labeled id and 2 button should pop up. On desktop, just type the other peer's id into the input and press enter. On mobile, type the other peer's id into the input and press the enter button. Both of these actions will end up with the same result, a button either to the right of or below the add button (below on desktop and to the right of on mobile). This button should have the id of the peer you are trying to connect to. If you click on this button, a connection will be attempted to be opened between the two peers. To connect to another peer make sure that you have their exact id (letter case does not matter) and that they are still active on the website. If all of these conditions are satisfied, a connection should be achieved. You will know that you have connected because the name on the button will change to the username of the other peer. The main message input will now be enabled, and if you type something into it and press enter (on desktop, return on mobile) the message will be sent to the other person.

## Editing Setting:
Currently only the apperance settings are the ones that are semi-bulit out. You can change the color theme by click on one of the two existing options (dark or light [you are evil if you use light]). There is a partially built custom color picker, but it doesn't fully work yet, coming soon.
